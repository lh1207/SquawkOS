# SquawkOS
SquawkOS is a game that parodies the Windows operating system by replacing all its elements with bird-related items. The game includes two mini-games and a simple MS Paint remake. The first mini-game is a remake of the popular game "Floppy Bird," where players will control a bird and attempt to navigate through obstacles by flapping their wings. The other mini-game is a card matching game, and the simple MS Paint program will only have 12 colors and 1 brush.
